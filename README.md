# Wannabe Manager - Module One Project - Flatiron School, London  

By Tom Rowson and Jack Ling

## Project Focus

The first module of Flatiron School is all about Ruby.
Tasked with writing an app in the CLI, we decided on using a fantasy football API to create a football manager style game.

The app will focus on CRUD - Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting.
