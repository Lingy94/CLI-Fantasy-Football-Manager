# Wannabe Manager - Module One Project - Flatiron School, London  

By Tom Rowson and Jack Ling

## Project Focus

The first module of Flatiron School is all about Ruby.
Tasked with writing an app in the CLI, we decided on using a fantasy football API to create a football manager style game.

The app will focus on CRUD - Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting.

## Setup

- Open terminal and cd into this directory.
- run `ruby lib/api_communicator.rb` to fetch players from the API
- run `ruby bin/run.rb` to launch to app

### How to Play

1. Enter your name and your team name.
2. Select your desired players: You must select 1 Goalkeeper, 1 Defender, 2 Midfielders and 1 Striker.
3. Choose to play against a default CPU generated team, or any other existing teams.
4. After the match, you can choose whether you want to continue playing and challenge somebody else, or exit.
5. Upon exiting, you will be asked if you would like to see your win/loss/draw stats.
6. Thanks for playing!
